current board is initial state 
	possible moves is successor states ?
	terminal states is the winning combos
	utility value is the board score = max for player turn, min for opponent
		high values are good for max, low values are bad for max
	
	three pieces to the minimax recursive function == 
		decision(board_state)
		max_value(board_state)
		min_value(board_state)
		
	A/B pruning
	depth.odd? && score == 10
